---

## Detailed Results

### 1. Deadlock Issues (1,256 - 54.3%)

**Description:** Deadlock scenarios occur when two or more processes are blocked waiting for resources held by each other, creating a circular dependency.

#### Top Problem Areas
- `kernel/locking/rtmutex.c` - 45 issues
- `kernel/locking/lockdep.c` - 39 issues
- `kernel/rcu/rcutorture.c` - 26 issues
- `fs/dlm/lock.c` - 19 issues
- `kernel/workqueue.c` - 17 issues

#### Common Patterns
```c
// Example deadlock pattern
lock_a();
lock_b();  // Potential deadlock if another thread does lock_b(); lock_a();
```

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** Critical
- **System Impact:** Complete system hang, kernel panic
- **Detection Difficulty:** Runtime only, hard to detect statically

### 2. Double Lock Issues (573 - 24.8%)

**Description:** Double locking occurs when the same lock is acquired multiple times, potentially causing performance issues or incorrect behavior.

#### Top Problem Areas
- `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dml/dcn30/display_mode_vba_30.c` - 44 issues
- `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dml/dcn314/display_mode_vba_314.c` - 42 issues
- `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dml/dcn32/display_mode_vba_util_32.c` - 40 issues

#### Common Patterns
```c
// Example double lock pattern
spin_lock(&lock);
// ... some code ...
spin_lock(&lock);  // Double lock - same lock acquired twice
```

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** High
- **System Impact:** Performance degradation, potential deadlock
- **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - can be detected statically

### 3. Race Condition Issues (384 - 16.6%)

**Description:** Race conditions occur when the behavior of a system depends on the relative timing of events, leading to unpredictable results.

#### Top Problem Areas
- `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/bios/init.c` - 7 issues
- `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/vcn_v1_0.c` - 4 issues
- `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/vcn_v2_0.c` - 4 issues

#### Common Patterns
```c
// Example race condition pattern
if (shared_variable == expected_value) {
    // Time window where another thread can modify shared_variable
    shared_variable = new_value;  // Race condition
}
```

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** High
- **System Impact:** Data corruption, undefined behavior, security vulnerabilities
- **Detection Difficulty:** High - timing dependent, hard to reproduce

### 4. Missing Lock Issues (101 - 4.4%)

**Description:** Missing locks occur when shared resources are accessed without proper synchronization, leading to data races.

#### Top Problem Areas
- `drivers/clk/tegra/clk-dfll.c` - 4 issues
- `drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_cx0_phy.c` - 4 issues
- `drivers/spi/atmel-quadspi.c` - 3 issues

#### Common Patterns
```c
// Example missing lock pattern
shared_counter++;  // Missing lock - unprotected access to shared variable
```

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** Medium to High
- **System Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent state
- **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - can be detected with static analysis

## Code Examples and Patterns

### Deadlock Pattern Examples

#### Circular Dependency
```c
// Thread 1
lock_a();
lock_b();

// Thread 2  
lock_b();
lock_a();  // DEADLOCK: Circular dependency
```

#### Resource Waiting
```c
// Example from kernel/locking/rtmutex.c
if (rt_mutex_has_waiters(lock)) {
    // Potential deadlock if waiters hold other locks
    rt_mutex_wait_for_lock(lock);
}
```

### Race Condition Pattern Examples

#### Check-Then-Act Race
```c
// Example from fs/aio.c
if (file->f_op->aio_read) {
    // Race condition: file->f_op could change between check and use
    ret = file->f_op->aio_read(file, iocb, nr_segs);
}
```

#### Unprotected Counter Access
```c
// Example from net/socket.c
socket_count++;  // Race condition: unprotected increment
```

### Double Lock Pattern Examples

#### Reentrant Lock Issue
```c
// Example from fs/pipe.c
pipe_lock(pipe);
// ... some code ...
pipe_lock(pipe);  // Double lock on same pipe
```
